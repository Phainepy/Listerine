#This is a project in a collaboration with my friend Tom. Taking the concept of a game like Wordle. However the premise of the game is a bit different.
#It's a game about lists. A question will be poised to the player and the player will then have a bucket of options to choose from.
#The player will have to list the items in the correct order in order to "win" or "get points." Similar concept of wordle where if they're close,
#they should receive an indicator.

#an example: "According to The Social Security Administration, the most common Male names born between 1922 and 2021 are?"
#The user will get a list of 20 names but will have to list the top 10 names in a "correct" order. If the name TOM is in the top ten they should get a #green indicator if it's in the exact right spot. But a yellow indicator if it's in the wrong spot, but still in the top 10. Grey for not in it.
